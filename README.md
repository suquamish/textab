# textab
Simple text editor for the browser

---

Sometimes I just want a simple text editor for sketching out ideas or taking
notes during stand-up, so I threw this together.  It ain't pretty, and it does
not even approach fancy, but it does exactly what I want.

Make a bookmark the texttab.html file, and you're ready to go.
